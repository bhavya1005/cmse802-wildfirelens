# Wildfire Risk Prediction and Simulation
This repository contains our final project for CMSE 802 at Michigan State University.

The goal of this project is to explore wildfire data in the United States and build a tool that can help identify areas at higher risk for wildfires. The project involves data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and training a simple classification model. We also created a basic simulation that models how a wildfire might spread in a region based on starting conditions.

## Project Features
- Load and explore historical wildfire data
- Classify wildfire risk based on features like location and size
- Simulate wildfire spread on a 2D grid
- Basic command-line interface for running predictions and simulations
- Visualizations for data trends and fire spread

## Tools and Libraries
- Python
- pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scikit-learn
- argparse for CLI
- Jupyter Notebook for analysis

## Dataset
I used the "1.88 Million US Wildfires" dataset from Kaggle, which includes records of wildfires in the U.S. from 1992 to 2015.
